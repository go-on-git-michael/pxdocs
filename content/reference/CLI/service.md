   -c, --cycle  cycle maintenance mode
```

Enter maintenance mode with:

```text
pxctl service maintenance --enter
```

```output
This is a disruptive operation, PX will restart in maintenance mode.
Are you sure you want to proceed ? (Y/N): y
```

Exit maintenance mode by running:

```text
pxctl service maintenance --exit
```


### pxctl service drive

You can manage the physical storage drives on a node using the pxctl service drive sub menu.

```text
pxctl service drive
```

```

### pxctl service pool cache

You can use the `pxct service pool cache command` command to:

* Disable caching on a pool
* Enable caching on a pool
* Force the cache to be flushed
* Check if pool caching is enabled for a pool

Refer to the [Pool caching](/concepts/pool-caching) section for more details.

### pxctl service pool delete

You can use the `pxctl service pool delete` command to delete storage pools which may be misconfigured or otherwise not functioning properly.

```text
pxctl service pool delete --help
```
```output
Delete pool
Usage:
  pxctl service pool delete [flags]
Flags:
  -h, --help   help for delete
Global Flags:
      --ca string        path to root certificate for ssl usage
      --cert string      path to client certificate for ssl usage
      --color            output with color coding
      --config string    config file (default is $HOME/.pxctl.yaml)
      --context string   context name that overrides the current auth context
  -j, --json             output in json
      --key string       path to client key for ssl usage
      --raw              raw CLI output for instrumentation
      --ssl              ssl enabled for portworx
```

Before you remove a pool, consider the following requirements:

* Your target pool for deletion must be empty and contain no replicas
* If your target pool for deletion is a metadata pool, it must be readable
* You must have more pools on the node than just your target pool for deletion
* You must place your node in maintenance mode to use this command

The following example deletes a storage pool from a node containing 2 storage pools:

```text
pxctl service pool delete 0
```
```output
This will permanently remove storage pool and cannot be undone.
Are you sure you want to proceed ? (Y/N): y
Pool 0 DELETED.
```

{{<info>}}
**NOTE:** New pools created after a pool deletion increment from the last pool ID. A new pool created after this example would have a pool ID of 2
